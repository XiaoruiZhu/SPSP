Title: Selection by Partitioning the Solution Paths
Description: An implementation of the approach for feature selection based on the entire solution 
            paths rather than the choice of a single tuning parameter, which significantly improves
            the accuracy of the selection (Liu, Y., & Wang, P. (2018)). Since the SPSP approach is 
            based on the solution paths. One can incorporate it with the solution paths of Lasso, 
            adaptive Lasso, or ridge regression. This package provides the SPSP selection tool that
            can incorporate the Lasso, adaptive Lasso, and ridge regression.
